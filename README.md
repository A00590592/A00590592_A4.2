Code for Activity 4.2.

This repository contains the code developed for Activity 4.2.

It includes three Python scripts:

computeStatistics.py | convertNumbers.py | wordCount.py

Project Structure

The project is organized by problem (P1, P2, P3).
Each problem follows the same directory structure:

P1/

 ├─ source/
 
 ├─ tests/
 
 ├─ results/
 
 └─ pylint/

P2/
 
 ├─ source/
 
 ├─ tests/
 
 ├─ results/
 
 └─ pylint/

P3/

 ├─ source/
 
 ├─ tests/
 
 ├─ results/
 
 └─ pylint/

Folder Description

source/: 
Contains the Python source code for the problem.
Each program must be executed from this directory using the command line.

tests/: 
Contains input test files used to validate program behavior.

results/: 
Stores the output files generated by the program execution.

pylint/: 
Contains the pylint analysis reports generated for each program.

Execution Notes

All programs are designed to be executed from their corresponding source directory.

Each script is executed from the command line and receives an input file as a parameter.

Example:
python computeStatistics.py ..\tests\TC1.txt
python convertNumbers.py ..\tests\TC1.txt
python wordCount.py ..\tests\TC1.txt

A short video demonstrating the execution and results of the programs is included.
